### Features & Philosophy

I saw the TailwindUI job posting while working on another website on May 20th. I decided to apply, and quickly made a simple [paste](https://pasteapp.com/p/Y7WGkslVK34?view=w1NXIGoMOQ2) slide deck to scaffold out the idea and the copy, and to ensure that I'd have something to submit.

Once I had that, I decided (to be as impressive as possible) I better try and build a quick site for my application. I'd been messing around with Preact and React and had set myself up a start template, so I cloned over a blank copy and got to work.

**Site is built with**

![Preact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/preactjs/preact/8b0bcc927995c188eca83cba30fbc83491cc0b2f/logo.svg?sanitize=true)
![TailwindCSS](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/87d7034892fd41dc88f3606bb44b853f87cd2c51/68747470733a2f2f7265666163746f72696e6775692e6e7963332e63646e2e6469676974616c6f6365616e7370616365732e636f6d2f7461696c77696e642d6c6f676f2e737667)

_of course_
