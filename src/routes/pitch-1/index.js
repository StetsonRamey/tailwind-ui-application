        I'm negotiable on the comp, and I'm open to significantly less than your
        posted offer. I recognize this as an ideal opportunity to learn from
        Adam while working on something exciting with cool people, and that is
        worth a big chunk of comp to me. I know I'm going to learn much faster
        by working with Adam and better with the accountability of working in a
        team that's depending on me.

        That said, I'm not a complete noob. I work hard and learn fast. I won't
        waste your time. I'll figure things out on my own and if I absolutely
        can't I will ask direct questions.

        I understand what starting and building a company takes, cause I've done
        it and it's hard. So I'll pull my weight and you'll be able to count on
        me to do what I say I'm going to do and contribute to your company.
