        I get it if you have to have a pro. Adam you need someone to unload some
        work on and you and I both know I'll need more help for a little while
        than a more senior engineer.

      <p class="mb-2">
        In the case you have to hire a pro, but you could use someone for lower
        level stuff that's not worth your time (or that you shouldn't be
        spending your time on), I'm willing to trade my time for mentoring. It{' '}

            if at any time it's not working for you, walk away no obligation

        I've been following tailwind since well before version 1. What you guys
        are doing is cool, and as someone who's trying to teach themsevles and
        has watched a lot of people online, Adam I think you're one of the best
        at showing, explaining, and doing.

        I think I can be a meaningful part of your team and contribute to what
        you're doing and the opportunity for me to learn is huge. So give me a
        shot. Thank you.
