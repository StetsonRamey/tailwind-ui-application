        I did every job myself for the first 14 months. Then I hired roles 1 at
        a time to offload some of my workload.

        Sold last year to my PM Ryan (who is my partner for the holiday lighting
        company) and he's doing a great job running things. I still consult

        I decided during this period I needed to learn web development. I had
        great difficulty hiring an agency that could execute my vision for a
        website and perform effective SEO. Anyone I hired that was
        ~$1k-$2k/month wasn't great, and our company couldn't even afford that
        when we started.

      <p className="italic text-sm">
        The current website I hired out. It cost $10k and GPP pays $1500/mo for
        SEO, and I write the blog content. It's fine but it's just a Wordpress
        Elementor site builder custom build. Nothing truly "custom". This got me
        thinking I should start learning some modern web development.
