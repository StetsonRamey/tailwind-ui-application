        It's tough for me to answer that. I've never met you or talked to you. I
        don't know how you work or what you're like. I don't know what values
        you have or what worldviews you all hold. I will answer based on the
        only information I have which is -- a) the product you've built and b)
        the online Adam I've interacted with via Youtube and Twitter.

        I believe you and the team are people genuinely curious about technology
        and what looks like work to other people feels like play to you. What
        you're doing, building Tailwind isn't so much of a job as it is
        something exciting you get paid for. I too am fascianted by technology,
        and often wonder what a different life I'd have if I'd studied computer
        science in college (different conversation). Computers and the internet
        provide incredible leverage, and I think that most people are just
        starting to figure that out. With a team of 4 people you are building
        something that will potentially be used by millions (or at least
        hundreds of thousands). That's insane to think about! You can build from
        anywhere in the world you're connected to the internet.

        When I worked at Kiewit, I worked with thousands of other people. At
        that size, work is more about politics and allegiances than it is about
        quality of work (and this may not be true of all large organizations but
        I think it's easier to get that way with size). I've kept the companies
        I started small by design, and rather than increasing employees to scale
        revenue, looked at efficiency, cost of goods sold, and marketing spend
        to increase revenue with the same team. I like working with 3-6 amazing
        people.

        Adam I get a sense that you're possibly like me in that if there is a
        problem you're working on it dominates your mind until you've solved it.
        Ever solved a problem in your sleep (or had the idea that led to the
        solution)? I have and something about the way you work on stuff gives me
        the sense that you're the same way. I can tell Steve loves beautiful
        design and interaction. As with me, I'm sure if he receives a
        recommendation for a business and hits their site on his phone and it's
        a straight 90's / non-mobile friendly atrocity he questions whether or
        not he wants to spend his money there. I think I see what you're doing
        with TailwindUI and it fits with a philosophy I stole from Amazon when I
        was in college. When they released the feature where you could purchase
        with 1 click it caught my attention and has stuck with me. Make it
        insanely easy for people to give you their money for something they like
        and you'll never have a problem with revenue. TailwindUI is doing that.

        This particular point, company fit, was my greatest challenge hiring
        others. Whether you hire me or not, I recommend a book called{' '}

        . I've read it maybe 8 times. When I began following it for my hiring, I
        started making excellent hires. Even with a method you can still get it
        wrong. If you decide to talk to me about this position if I see any red
        flags in our compatibility I'll be honest with you about it. As eager as
        I am to work and learn from you guys, I want to see you succeed and I
        don't want to waste months of your time if I think there's a shot I
        won't work out.

      The Future
    </p>
    <div class="pl-3 mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed md:text-lg">
      <p class="mb-4">
        The amazing thing about the future is that the possibilities are quite
        endless. I'm a planner and I make 1, 3, and 5 year goals annually. This
        wasn't in my 3 year goal for sure, but it fits my broader goal of making
        money, from anywhere in the world, with a computer and as few other
        resources as possible.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        My hope is that our future could look something like this -- I begin
        working with you now, while this product is small. My ideas and
        suggestions mesh well with yours and together we all build this into not
        just an incredible product, but an amazing company. In my twenties I
        chased money and just wanted to be rich. I thought it wouldn't matter
        what I did to get there, I just wanted to get there. I'm still not as
        rich as I'd like to be, but I have enough money now to know that for me
        the joy isn't in the money. I get most excited and happy about building
        things and figuring out cool solutions to hard problems that other
        people use to build other cool things and solutions to other hard
        problems. I really like how Richard Feynman said it (referring to honors
        and I am paraphrasing):
        <br />
        <div class="p-6">
          <span class="block p-4 bg-gray-400 rounded-sm italic">
            the joy isn't in the honor or being honored. The joy is in finiding
            the thing out. Honors aren't real. If I figured the thing out, other
            people appreciate the work, and other people find it useful, that's
            all I need.

      <p className="mb-4">
        To be clear, I'm a fan of getting paid for your work however now I view
        it as more of a side-effect of doing something great that other people
        are raving fans of and not the main goal.

        As someone fairly new to tech, to me TailwindCSS is one of the coolest
        things I've used. I love how you've built it and I love what you're
        doing with it. Sometimes I'll just snoop around the repo and read the
        code to see if I can figure out what's going on with all of it when I
        don't know what else to do. I think the fact that some die-hards hate it
        is a great sign! Often, great ideas look terrible to a lot of people at
        first (AirBnb). If they didn't, they'd have already been implemented
        (according to Paul Grahm). To build both the product and the business
        and get really, really good with the tools in the process seems like the
        perfect fit to me. I see a bright and exciting future.

      The Future of Tech
    </p>
    <div class="pl-3 mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed md:text-lg">
      <p class="mb-4">
        I'm really excited about what Rich Harris is doing with Svelte. I think
        at it's core that's an excellent idea, and it won't surprise me if we
        see more of that approach (compiler over framework) in the future. I
        respect and admire Guillermo Rauch and what he's doing with Zeit (now
        Vercel). His podcast episode with Adam is one of my alltime favorites.
        The fact that they just raised a $20mil+ series A and have Naval
        Ravikant on the venture team to me means he's looking in the right
        direction. To be honest as I planned to build a web dev businesses I had
        it narrowed down to React vs Svelte and mainly due to Guillermo's
        enthusiasm about React I chose to focus the bulk of my time on it while
        keeping up on Svelte.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Of course I feel that I know very little about this particular slice of
        the tech world and predicting the future is impossible. However it is
        fun to muse about what the future of tech could be. I think we'll see
        further abstraction away from code, which intuitively makes sense.
        Capitalism looks for numbers, and not everyone will become coders as
        rapidly as coders will figure out how to sell products to non-coders. I
        was amazed at the systems I could hack together without touching any
        code for our companies. For painting we have an automated pipeline from
        estimate scheduling through to job booking that has worked great for
        years (it's not perfect but it works) and I never wrote any code. I
        think we'll see more powerful products (built of course by coders) that
        allow people or businesses (non-coders) to do powerful business
        functions. Like Wix or Airtable on steroids.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Here's where the prediction gets bold but likely pretty wobbly. I think
        React and Vue will stick around for a long time and dominate as
        platforms that allow businesses with huge userbases to build what they
        need to build at scale. It seems to me the probability of them being
        knocked out by a newcomer is slim. However, I think that because they'll
        get used by the big dogs of the internet that they'll become less
        approachable for the many many new people who are trying to learn to
        hack (as the focus will be keeping their big customers happy, even
        though they're open source). I think that things like Svelte will step
        into that space and I think they'd be wise to market themselves as a
        newbie friendly approach.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In general and especially since the COVID pandemic has shown lots of
        companies can leverage tech to reduce their real estate footprint (and
        therefore overhead cost) we'll continue to see this move away from the
        traditional employer/employee model. I'm not sure if we'll all be
        contractors/freelancers in the future, but those who are I think will
        have the advantage. My bet for the future is that businesses who can
        understand the needs of individuals/small teams but lots and lots of
        them, rather than building products for large companies will do well.
        Kinda like a mobile first approach for customers. Individual first, but
        large companies can also use this product. That's my 2 cents.
